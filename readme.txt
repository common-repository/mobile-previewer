Adds a small frame for logged in users at the bottom right of every page that shows the a resized version of the current page for responsive testing.

== Description ==

Adds a responsive preview for logged in users. On hover, the frame is resized to show more detail. The preview window will scroll automaticly when the normal view is scrolled.

This is a great plugin both to keep the editors aware of how the content may vary on different devices and help theme developers view the site in different sizes at once without having to resize the browser.

This plugin was developed by [Wallmander&Co](http://www.wallmanderco.se/ "Wallmander&Co") to use on our clients websites.
